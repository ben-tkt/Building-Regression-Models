# Hackathon: Regression Models for Shinkansen Satisfaction [Still in process of uploading 🙇]

## 🎯 My Objectives
* To share my work
* Receive feedback on improving methods
* Serve as reference material for anyone trying to learn how to use Machine Learning Models to create Regression Models. 

## 📓 Project Description 
* **Objective** - To understand data and build a regression model for Shinkansen company to predict if a Shinkansen passenger will be satisfied with the travel experience.
* **Problem Statement** - Perform EDA on data, build regression models using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization algorithms,tune the hyperparameters, and provide business recommendations.
* **Data Source** - Provided by Great Learning as materials for the project. [Can be found in repository]

## 📓 Data Dictionary
* ID - The unique ID of the passenger
* Gender - The gender of the passenger
* Customer_Type - Loyalty type of the passenger
* Age - The age of the passenger
* Type_Travel - Purpose of travel for the passenger
* Travel_Class - The train class that the passenger traveled in
* Travel_Distance - The distance traveled by the passenger
* Departure_Delay_in_Mins - The delay (in minutes) in train departure
* Arrival_Delay_in_Mins - The delay (in minutes) in train arrival
* ID - The unique ID of the passenger
* Platform_Location - How convenient the location of the platform is for the passenger
* Seat_Class - The type of the seat class in the train. Green Car seats are usually more spacious and comfortable than ordinary seats. On the Shinkansen train, there are only four seats per row in the Green Car, versus five in the ordinary car.
* Overall_Experience - The overall experience of the passenger
* Seat_Comfort - The comfort level of the seat for the passenger
* Arrival_Time_Convenient - How convenient the arrival time of the train is for the passenger
* Catering - How convenient the catering service is for the passenger
* Onboard_Wifi_Service - The quality of the onboard Wi-Fi service for the passenger
* Onboard_Entertainment - The quality of the onboard entertainment for the passenger
* Online_Support - The quality of the online support for the passenger
* Ease_of_Online_Booking - The ease of online booking for the passenger
* Onboard_Service - The quality of the onboard service for the passenger
* Legroom - the general term used in place of the more accurate “seat pitch”, which is the distance between a point on one seat and the same point on the seat in front of it. This variable describes the convenience of the legroom provided for the passenger
* Baggage_Handling - The convenience of baggage handling for the passenger
* CheckIn_Service - The convenience of the check-in service for the passenger
* Cleanliness - The passenger's view of the cleanliness of the service
* Online_Boarding - The convenience of the online boarding process for the passenger

## 📓Key Features Used
* Libraries used - Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikitlearn, Surprise, tensorflow
* Software used - Python programming, Google Colab

## 📓 Techniques used
* **Cleaning data** from irrelevant data, missing data, duplicated data and outliers
* **Data visualization** using seaborn plots
* **Exploratory Data Analysis** (Univariate and multivariate)
* **Building and Pruning Decision Tree**
* **Building and Pruning Random Forest**
* **Building and Tuning Deep Learning Models**
* **Model Evaluation** using k-fold validation using f1-score, precision and recall
* **Model Tuning** via GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV

## 📓 Usage Guide
**For Recruiters**
1. Open up the .ipynb or .HTML file to understand into details what was done in the project.
2. Kindly contact me if you want to know more 😃

**For Learners**
1. Download the dataset from [link]() and the .ipynb file.
2. Open the .ipynb file using Google Colaboratory or jupyter notebook.
3. Read through the project context, objective, data description and dictionary.
4. Try and run the code in the .ipynb notebook, cell by cell. As the codes are well-commented, try to understand what each line of code does.
5. Use my code as a reference if you're stucked [Note that my solutions are not perfect, it only achieved an accuracy of 80% on unseen data. There is much space for improvements, but for now it is good enough to create working predictive models]

**Thanks for reaching the end!**
